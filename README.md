# Titanic Data Visualization with Seaborn

This project explores the Titanic dataset using the **Seaborn** data visualization library. It includes various types of plots like bar plots, violin plots, regression plots, and heatmaps to extract insights about passenger demographics, survival rates, and fare distributions.

Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

### Key Features
- **Categorical plots**: barplots, violinplots
- **Continuous data**: regression plots with confidence intervals
- **Heatmaps** for correlation analysis
- **Subplotting and customization** using Matplotlib integration
- **Data filtering & transformation** using pandas

All visualizations are constructed using Seaborn as the core plotting tool, with Matplotlib used for layout and customization.
